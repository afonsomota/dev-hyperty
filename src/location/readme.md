#Location hyperty

##1. Location hyperty functionality description.
Location is an App Hyperty which provides the location of user. In this implementation the location is obtained from the [Geolocation API](https://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source.html)exposed by the browser.
This hyperty has been developed as a App Hyperty. It means it is executed in the same sandbox as the main web application which uses it. However it is a candidate to become a Service Hyperty (executed in a independient web worker) in further phases of the project.

Note: currently this Hyperty is limited to the browser runtime but it can adapted to be usablein the browser runtime as it uses the Gelocation API exposed by the browser. However it can be adapted to be used in the Node.js and Standalone runtimes.
