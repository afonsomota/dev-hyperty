#Notifications hyperty 

The Notifications hyperty is divided into two other components. First one is the NotificationsReporter that allows sending notifications to specific hyperties. The second one is the NotificationObserver that triggers an event for each notification received. In addition, a library is provided in order to allow hyperties to trigger notification to their observer.
