### User Availability Hyperties

The User Availability is comprised by two Hyperties.

The User Availability Reporter manages user availability state ('available', 'unavailable', 'busy', 'away') by publishing it to a certain Context Resource URL and handling subscriptions requests from User Availability Observer.

The User Availability Observer provides the monitoring of availability from multiple users. It enables the discovery of users publishing its Availability Context and the subscription to it.
